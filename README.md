# haunted-giphy-site

A spooky haunted house themed website that generates "haunted photos" on the wall when the user clicks a button. If the user clicks an image, it will move, and if clicked again, it will go still.

The user can also generate their own buttons by typing a search term into the provided input form. 

Pictures are generated using the giphy API.
